# alerts

The proactive path (design: [`docs/architecture/components/06-alerts-service.md`](../../docs/architecture/components/06-alerts-service.md)).
Alexa+ cannot speak first, so when a watched line changes, the consented watcher is told by SMS from here.

What it does:

- **Two triggers, one evaluation.** CAMARA subscription webhooks (`POST /hooks/{kind}/{sink_token}`) and
  scheduled polls (`{profile}` from EventBridge Scheduler, or the local scheduler) both call
  `evaluate.evaluate(line_id, trigger, now)`: consent first → carrier facts → `tower_policy.evaluate_line` /
  `evaluate_reachability` → diff against `Watches.last_state` → windows → a `Decision`.
- **Release.** `send.deliver`: re-read the grant (revoked → `SUPPRESSED_REVOKED`), rate limit (one alert per
  line, watcher and reason per 6 h; repeats audited), audit row, then SMS. Templates are `tower_policy.phrase(form="sms")`.
- **Revocation stops the watching (06 §4).** Subscriptions are kept only for Watches that are enabled *and*
  consented (owner or an active `watch` grant). Each poll's watchdog also visits lines whose Watches of that
  profile are all off, unsubscribes what nothing needs, re-subscribes at once when the needed kinds shrank, and
  never re-subscribes after a revoke. An event after a revoke is audited `SUPPRESSED_REVOKED`.
- **Recipients.** The escalation chain on the Watch (default: the watcher) plus the line-holder at their alert
  phone — except after a SIM swap of the line: then the line-holder's backup phone if any, and nobody whose
  phone *is* the swapped line is texted.
- **Escalation.** A chain step with `requires_ack` waits 15 min for "OK"/"CANCEL"; no reply → next step. A reply
  from a line within 24 h of its own SIM swap is ignored, audited `ACK_IGNORED_SWAPPED_LINE`, and the watcher's
  next message says so.
- **Failures.** A failed observation is never a change: `last_state` is kept, misses are counted, the 3rd
  consecutive miss writes one `CARRIER_ERROR` row. An SMS is retried once, then `ALERT_FAILED` and the next
  recipient. Subscriptions silent for more than TTL/2 are renewed by the poller; `subscription-ended` renews at once.

What it doesn't do: decide anything `tower_policy` doesn't (no model), store or log a phone number (numbers
are decrypted only for the carrier call and the SMS send), or alert on the absence of data.

## Layout

| Module | |
|---|---|
| `evaluate.py` | `evaluate()`, `decide()` (pure), `watch_consent()`, `fetch_facts()` |
| `windows.py` | pure window arithmetic: continuous-false clock, 20 min / 4 h, daytime 08–22, rate limit, ACK_DISTRUST |
| `send.py` / `send_backends.py` | `deliver()`, recipients, `SmsSender` Protocol: `SnsSender`, `LogSender`, `WebhookSmsSender` |
| `escalation.py` | `start_chain`, `tick`, `handle_reply` |
| `subscriptions.py` | `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` / `watchdog`; sink URL per line and kind |
| `hooks.py` | webhook receiver: vendored CloudEvents schema, token → line, dedupe |
| `internal_api.py` | `POST /internal/watch` (Tower's `watch_line`), `POST /inbound/sms` (local reply relay) |
| `runner.py` | `process_line`, `poll`, `build_service` |
| `handler.py` | Lambda entry: API Gateway, Scheduler `{profile}`, SNS inbound, direct `{"action": "watch"}` |
| `local.py` | FastAPI app + in-process scheduler (`python -m alerts.local`) |
| `state.py` | the `AlertsState` table (sink tokens, dedupe, rate-limit claims, escalations, misses) |
| `templates.py` | `tower_policy.phrase(form="sms")` + the one ack-ignored sentence |
| `schemas/*.cloudevents.json` | generated from `specs/camara/` by `scripts/vendor_schemas.py` (`--check` in tests) |
| `testing.py` | `FakeCarrier`, `World`, in-process wiring helpers (tests and showcase only) |

## State

`Watches.last_state` (`sim_change_at, cf_status, reachable, unreachable_since, last_alert_at, at`) moves only
on a complete observation, so Tower's stored-state path (02 §4) can trust its `at`. Everything else lives in
one small Alerts-owned table, **`AlertsState`** (PK `pk`, TTL `expires_at`; definition
`alerts.state.terraform_definition()` for Terraform):

| `pk` | Holds |
|---|---|
| `sink#<token>` | sink token → `line_id` |
| `line#<line_id>` | sink token, subscription ids, `subs_at`, `last_event_at`, `misses` |
| `evt#<digest>` | webhook dedupe (7-day TTL) |
| `rl#<line>#<watcher>#<code>` | rate-limit claim (6-h TTL) |
| `esc#<line>#<watcher>` | escalation in flight |
| `ack#<phone line_id>` | which escalation a reply from that phone acknowledges |

**Dedupe design.** Idempotency is a conditional `PutItem` (`attribute_not_exists(pk)`) of
`evt#SHA-256(sink token, CloudEvents source, id)` (hex re-lettered a–p) with a 7-day TTL — CloudEvents ids are
unique per source, and the token keeps two lines' sources apart. A duplicate is answered 200 and dropped.

## Run

```bash
uv run pytest services/alerts -q                     # moto + DynamoDB Local (when docker info works)
TOWER_DDB_BACKENDS=moto uv run pytest services/alerts -q
uv run python -m alerts.local                        # port ALERTS_PORT=8082 (mk/vars.mk ALERTS_URL); needs DynamoDB Local + mock carrier
make showcase-alerts                                 # §2.6, in-process; --fast to skip pacing
docker build -f services/alerts/Dockerfile -t ask-the-tower/alerts .
```

**Kubernetes** (`deploy/helm/alerts`, prompt 14): `ALERTS_MODE=k8s` runs the same FastAPI app (hooks + internal
API + health) without the in-process scheduler; the 10 §3 schedules are CronJobs running
`python -m alerts.job poll transplant|care|self`, `python -m alerts.job tick` and `python -m alerts.job reconcile`,
which hand the EventBridge payload to the Lambda dispatcher. The sender defaults to `sns` as in `lambda` mode
(kind sets `ALERTS_SENDER=log`); with `DYNAMO_ENDPOINT` set (kind) the tables are created at start-up as locally.

## Config

See `.env.example` and the table in `src/alerts/config.py`. The essentials: `ALERTS_MODE` (`lambda`|`local`|`k8s`),
`HOOKS_BASE_URL` (must be `https://` — CAMARA sinks are), `INTERNAL_BEARER`, `ALERTS_SENDER`
(`sns`|`log`|`webhook`), `SNS_TOPIC_ARN` (inbound replies topic), `SMS_GATEWAY_URL`, `ALERTS_CLOCK`,
`ALERTS_CLOCK_SCALE`, `CARRIER_*` (Alerts defaults: `CARRIER_PROFILE=proactive`, `CARRIER_CLIENT_ID=alerts`),
`DYNAMO_ENDPOINT` (alias of `TOWER_DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT`), `TOWER_ENV` + keys.

**`ALERTS_CLOCK_SCALE` and the mock clock.** Two different things move in a demo. *Time* — what `now` is —
comes from the clock: with `ALERTS_CLOCK=mock` every evaluation asks the mock carrier (`GET /_admin/clock`),
so the 20-minute transplant window, the 4-hour care window and the 15-minute escalation are measured on the
mock's scripted clock, the same clock that stamps the carrier's own `lastStatusTime`. *Cadence* — how often
the local scheduler wakes up to poll and tick — is the 10 §3 schedule divided by `ALERTS_CLOCK_SCALE`. Set the
scale to match how fast the mock clock is being moved: the showcase advances the mock one minute per real
second, and with `ALERTS_CLOCK_SCALE=60` the scheduler polls once per simulated poll interval, so "20 minutes
dark" takes 20 seconds on camera. A mismatch is safe, never wrong: a scale too high polls more often than
needed (same decisions — evaluation is idempotent and rate-limited), too low only delays an alert to the next
poll. The scale never changes a window; only the clock does.

## Showcase

`make showcase-alerts` (`scripts/showcase.py`) runs testing-and-showcase §2.6 locally, in one process: enable
the watch → admin `sim_swap` on Mom → the watcher's text is logged within the 5 s budget (Mom's own number is
not texted) → repeat within 6 h → audited only → revoke → `SUPPRESSED_REVOKED` → transplant: 19 min dark →
nothing, 20 → first text, +15 min without an ack → the second contact. The transcript is written to
`artifacts/transcripts/alerts-showcase.log`. On AWS the phone is real (SNS); that run is deferred.

## Wiring for other components

- Tower (`watch_line`): upsert the Watch, then `POST {ALERTS_INTERNAL_URL}/internal/watch` with
  `Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_BEARER` and `{"line_id", "enable", "profile"?, "watcher_user_id"?}`
  (or invoke the Lambda with `{"action": "watch", ...}`).
- Terraform: the `AlertsState` table (above); EventBridge Scheduler targets with input `{"profile": "<p>"}`;
  the SNS inbound topic subscription to the Lambda; API Gateway routes `/hooks/{kind}/{token}` and `/internal/watch`.
- Compose: the mock sends webhooks only to `https://` sinks, so a local compose stack needs TLS in front of
  Alerts (or the mock's loopback sink); prompt 12 decides.
